# Make Your Own Custom LinkedIn Frame in 1 Minute

Not long ago LinkedIn added a feature that allows adding a frame to your profile picture, letting everyone know if your are #hiring or #opentowork.

Now, you can create your own custom frames, adding a little more character to your LinkedIn profile.
